# Special Types of Functions and Their Graphs

In this lecture, we explore three important types of functions and analyze their graphs:

1. **Linear Functions**
2. **Quadratic Functions**  
3. **Exponential Functions**

## **1. Linear Functions**

### **Definition:**
A function f is called a **linear function** if it is of the form:

$$f(x) = ax + b$$

where a and b are real numbers. The graph of a linear function is a straight line.

- **Intercept**: The line passes through the point (0, b).
- **Gradient (Slope)**: Given by the value of a.

### **Increasing and Decreasing Linear Functions:**

- If a > 0, the function is **increasing**:
  For any x₁ ≤ x₂, we have f(x₁) ≤ f(x₂).
- If a < 0, the function is **decreasing**:
  For any x₁ ≤ x₂, we have f(x₁) ≥ f(x₂).

### **Example 1 (Increasing):**
$$f(x) = 3x + 2$$

- Make a function table for selected values of x.
- Plot two or more points, e.g., (0, 2) and (1, 5), and draw a straight line.
- The graph shows a line increasing from left to right.

### **Example 2 (Decreasing):**
$$f(x) = -3x + 2$$

- The gradient is negative (a = -3), so the function is decreasing.
- Plot example points and draw the line to see the decreasing behavior.

## **2. Quadratic Functions**

### **Definition:**
A function is called a **quadratic function** if it is of the form:

$$f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$$

where a, b, c ∈ ℝ and a ≠ 0.

### **Basic Example:**
$$f(x) = x^2$$

- a = 1, b = 0, c = 0
- The graph is a **parabola** opening upwards.
- It is **decreasing** for x < 0 and **increasing** for x > 0.
- **Domain**: ℝ
- **Range**: [0, ∞)

### **Example with Vertical Shift:**
$$g(x) = x^2 + 1$$

- This is f(x) = x² shifted **upwards** by 1 unit.
- **Domain**: ℝ
- **Range**: [1, ∞)

### **Effect of Coefficient a:**
- f(x) = ax², for various a:
  - a = 1/2, 1/4: wider parabolas
  - a = -1/2, -1/4: downward-opening, symmetric about the x-axis

## **3. Exponential Functions**

### **Definition:**
An **exponential function** has the form:

$$f(x) = b^x$$

where b > 0 and b ≠ 1. The constant b is called the **base**.

### **Examples:**
- If b = 2, then f(2) = 2² = 4
- If b = 1/2, then f(2) = (1/2)² = 1/4

### **Exponential Laws:**
1. $b^x \cdot b^y = b^{x+y}$
2. $\frac{b^x}{b^y} = b^{x-y}$
3. $(b^x)^y = b^{xy}$
4. $(a \cdot b)^x = a^x \cdot b^x$
5. $\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)^x = \frac{a^x}{b^x}$
6. $b^{-x} = \frac{1}{b^x}$

## **Exponential Growth and Decay**

### **Growth (b > 1):**
- The function is **increasing**.
- Graph passes through (0,1).
- **Horizontal asymptote**: x-axis (y = 0)
- **Domain**: ℝ
- **Range**: (0, ∞)

### **Decay (0 < b < 1):**
- The function is **decreasing**.
- Graph also passes through (0,1).
- Same domain and range as the growth case.
- x-axis remains the horizontal asymptote.

## **Summary**

- **Linear Functions**: Straight lines, determined by slope a
  - Increasing if a > 0, decreasing if a < 0
- **Quadratic Functions**: Parabolic curves, shape determined by a
  - Range depends on the sign of a
- **Exponential Functions**: Curves representing rapid growth or decay
  - Growth if b > 1, decay if 0 < b < 1
