# **Propositions** in propositional logic:

### **What is a Proposition?**

A **proposition** is a **declarative sentence** that is **either true or false**, **but not both**.
It’s the **most basic building block** of logic.

---

### **Examples of Valid Propositions**

These are **valid** because they are declarative and have a clear **truth value**:

| Statement                         | Proposition? | Truth Value |
| --------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| "London is the capital of the UK" | ✅ Yes        | True        |
| "1 + 1 = 2"                       | ✅ Yes        | True        |
| "2 < 3"                           | ✅ Yes        | True        |
| "Madrid is the capital of France" | ✅ Yes        | False       |
| "3 < 2"                           | ✅ Yes        | False       |
| "10 is an odd number"             | ✅ Yes        | False       |

### **Examples of Non-Propositions**

These are **not propositions** because they:

* Are **not declarative**
* Or **don’t have a clear truth value**

| Statement               | Reason Not a Proposition                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| "x + 1 = 2"             | Depends on unknown variable `x`             |
| "x + y = z"             | Depends on unknown variables                |
| "What time is it?"      | A question, not declarative                 |
| "Read this carefully"   | A command, not declarative                  |
| "This coffee is strong" | Too vague / subjective (depends on opinion) |

However, the first two **can become** propositions **if values are assigned** to the variables.

### **Using Propositional Variables**

To **simplify notation**, we use letters like `p`, `q`, `r` to represent entire propositions.

For example:

```plaintext
p: London is the capital of the United Kingdom  
q: 1 + 1 = 2  
r: 2 < 3  
s: 1 + 0 = 1
```

These variables are then used in logical formulas (like `p ∧ q` or `¬r`) to build more complex logical statements.

---

### Summary

* A **proposition** must be a declarative sentence with a definite truth value (true or false).
* **Questions**, **commands**, and **vague statements** are **not** propositions.
* **Propositional variables** are a shorthand for writing logic clearly and concisely.
