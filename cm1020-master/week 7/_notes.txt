Universal Quantifier (∀)

- Symbol: ∀
- Meaning: "For all" or "For every"
- Usage: ∀x P(x) means "For all x, P(x) is true"
- Example: ∀x (x > 0 → x² > 0) means "For all x, if x is positive then x² is positive"

Existential Quantifier (∃)

- Symbol: ∃
- Meaning: "There exists" or "For some"
- Usage: ∃x P(x) means "There exists at least one x such that P(x) is true"
- Example: ∃x (x² = 4) means "There exists an x such that x² = 4"

Uniqueness Quantifier (∃!)

- Symbol: ∃!
- Meaning: "There exists exactly one"
- Usage: ∃!x P(x) means "There exists exactly one x such that P(x) is true"
- Example: ∃!x (x + 5 = 8) means "There exists exactly one x such that x + 5 = 8"

Logical Operators

Negation (¬)
- Symbol: ¬ (also written as ~)
- Meaning: "Not"
- Usage: ¬P means "P is false"

Conjunction (∧)
- Symbol: ∧
- Meaning: "And"
- Usage: P ∧ Q means "Both P and Q are true"

Disjunction (∨)

- Symbol: ∨
- Meaning: "Or"
- Usage: P ∨ Q means "P is true or Q is true (or both)"

Implication (→)

- Symbol: → (also written as ⇒)
- Meaning: "If...then"
- Usage: P → Q means "If P is true, then Q is true"

Equivalence (↔)

- Symbol: ↔ (also written as ⇔)
- Meaning: "If and only if"
- Usage: P ↔ Q means "P is true if and only if Q is true"

Nested Quantifiers

- ∀x ∀y P(x,y): "For all x and for all y, P(x,y) is true"
- ∃x ∃y P(x,y): "There exists an x and there exists a y such that P(x,y) is true"
- ∀x ∃y P(x,y): "For all x, there exists a y such that P(x,y) is true"
- ∃x ∀y P(x,y): "There exists an x such that for all y, P(x,y) is true"

Variable Status

- **Bound variable**: A variable within the scope of a quantifier
- **Free variable**: A variable not bound by any quantifier
