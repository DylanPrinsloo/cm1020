# Introduction to Predicate Logic

## What is Predicate Logic?

Predicate logic is a more powerful form of logic that extends propositional logic to overcome its limitations. While propositional logic deals with complete statements that have definite truth values, predicate logic allows for more complex reasoning involving variables, quantifiers, and predicates.

## Limitations of Propositional Logic

Propositional logic has two key limitations:

1. It cannot precisely express the meaning of complex mathematical statements
2. It only works with propositions (statements with known truth values)

## Why We Need Predicate Logic

Predicate logic allows us to:

1. **Express logical relationships between entities**: For example, consider this reasoning:
   - All men are mortal
   - Socrates is a man
   - Therefore, Socrates is mortal

   This type of reasoning cannot be represented in propositional logic but can be formalized using predicate logic.

2. **Handle statements with variables**: For example, the statement "xÂ² = 4" is not a proposition because its truth value depends on the value of x. Predicate logic can express these types of statements effectively.

## Key Differences

- **Propositional logic**: Works with complete statements that have fixed truth values
- **Predicate logic**: Works with predicates (expressions that become propositions when variables are assigned values)

Predicate logic provides the foundation for more sophisticated logical reasoning and is essential for formal mathematical proofs, computer science, and artificial intelligence.
