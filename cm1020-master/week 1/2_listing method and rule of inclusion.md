# **Summary of Representing Sets: Listing Method & Set-Builder Notation**

In set theory, there are two common ways to represent a set:

1. **Listing Method (Roster Method):**
   
   - **Definition:** The listing method involves writing out all the elements of a set in a list.
- 
   - **Examples:**
  
     - **Vowels:** For the set of vowels in the English alphabet, you write: {a, e, i, o, u}.
  
     - **Positive Integers Less Than 10:** For the set containing positive integers less than 10, you list: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}.
  
     - **Even Positive Integers Less Than 10:** You write the set as: {2, 4, 6, 8}.

2. **Set-Builder Notation:**
   
   - **Definition:** This method describes the elements of a set by stating a property or a rule that every member of the set must satisfy. It typically uses a variable and a condition.
  
   - **Examples:**
  
     - **Even Integers:** Every even integer can be expressed as 2n, where n can be any integer (n ∈ ℤ). Thus, the set is written as {2n | n ∈ ℤ}.
  
     - **Odd Integers:** Every odd integer can be written in the form 2n + 1, where n ∈ ℤ. So the set is written as {2n + 1 | n ∈ ℤ}.
  
     - **Rational Numbers (ℚ):** A rational number is any number that can be expressed as n/m where n and m are integers (m ≠ 0). This is written as {n/m | n, m ∈ ℤ and m ≠ 0}.
  
     - **Everyday Example (Objects in a Bag):** 
       - If you list every object explicitly (e.g., {pen, book, laptop, ...}), that is the listing method.
       - Alternatively, you can use set-builder notation by saying: {x | x is an object in my bag}.

**Detailed Worked Examples Using Set-Builder Notation:**

3. **Example with Multiplication Rule:**
  
   - **Set S1:** Defined as elements of the form 3n such that n is a natural number (ℕ) and n is strictly less than 6.
  
   - **Process:**
  
     - Substitute values for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
  
     - Compute: 3×1 = 3, 3×2 = 6, 3×3 = 9, 3×4 = 12, 3×5 = 15.
  
   - **Result:** S1 = {3, 6, 9, 12, 15}.

4. **Example with Exponentiation:**

   - **Set S2:** Consists of elements of the form 2^n, where n is an integer between 0 and 4 (inclusive).
  
   - **Process:**
  
     - Substitute values: n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4.
  
     - Compute: 2^0 = 1, 2^1 = 2, 2^2 = 4, 2^3 = 8, 2^4 = 16.
  
   - **Result:** S2 = {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}.

5. **Example with Negative Exponents:**
   
   - **Set S3:** Consists of elements of the form 2^(–n), where n is an integer between 0 and 8 (with 0 included and 8 excluded).
  
   - **Process:**
  
     - Substitute values for n = 0, 1, 2, …, 7.
  
     - Compute: 2^0 = 1, 2^(–1) = 1/2, 2^(–2) = 1/4, 2^(–3) = 1/8, …, 2^(–7) = 1/128.
  
   - **Result:** S3 = {1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32, 1/64, 1/128}.

# **Converting Between Representations:**

The lesson also covers how to convert a set from one representation to the other. For instance:

6. - **Starting with a Listing Representation:**

  - Consider a set listed as: {1/2, 1/4, 1/6, 1/8, 1/10}.
  
  - By observing the pattern, you notice that these elements are of the form 1/(2n) for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
  
  - **Set-builder Notation:** {1/(2n) | n ∈ ℤ, 1 ≤ n ≤ 5}.

- **Another Example:**

  - A set expressed as powers of 2: {1, 2, 4, 8, …, 128}.
  
  - The pattern is: 2^n with n from 0 to 7.
  
  - **Set-builder Notation:** {2^n | n ∈ ℤ, 0 ≤ n ≤ 7}.

- **General Pattern (Multiples of a Number):**
  - For a set where the elements are multiples of 3 (like 0, 3, 6, 9, …), this can be written using the set-builder notation:

  - **Notation:** {3n | n ∈ ℤ}.
