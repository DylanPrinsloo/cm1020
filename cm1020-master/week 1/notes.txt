set:                   S = {1, 2, 3}
cardinality:          |S| = 3
power set:             P(S) = {∅, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}}

cardinality of power set: |P(S)| = 8 = 2^3 = 2^|S|


In set theory, two sets are said to be disjoint if they have no elements in common. 

In other words, their intersection is the empty set. This means that for any two sets A 
and B, if 

A ∩ B = ∅

then A and B are disjoint.

For example, if A = {1, 2, 3} and B = {4, 5, 6}, there is no element that belongs to both A 
and B; hence, A and B are disjoint.

Disjointness is an important concept because it helps in understanding how sets are related. 
In probability theory, for instance, events that are disjoint (or mutually exclusive) cannot happen at the same time. This idea also appears in discussions about partitions of a set, where the subsets in the partition are pairwise disjoint.
