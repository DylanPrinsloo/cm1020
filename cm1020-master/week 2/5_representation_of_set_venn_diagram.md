## **Key Concepts:**

1. **Universal Set (`U`):**
   
   - This is the set that contains all possible elements under consideration. It's usually denoted by the letter 'U'. In a Venn diagram, the universal set is often represented by a rectangle that encompasses all other sets.

2. **Subset (`A`):**
   
   - A set A is considered a subset of the universal set U if every element of A is also an element of U. In Venn diagrams, this is depicted by drawing circle A entirely within the rectangle representing U.

3. **Complement of a Set: (This has a dash hat on-top)(`A'`):**
   
   - The complement of set A, denoted as A', includes all elements that are in the universal set U but not in A. In Venn diagrams, the area representing A' is the part of the universal set that lies outside the circle representing A.

## **Set Operations Represented in Venn Diagrams:**

1. **Union (`A ∪ B`):**
   
   - The union of sets A and B includes all elements that are in A, in B, or in both. In a Venn diagram, this is represented by the total area covered by both circles A and B.

2. **Intersection (`A ∩ B`):**
   
   - The intersection of sets A and B consists of all elements that are common to both sets. In the Venn diagram, this is shown by the overlapping area of circles A and B.

3. **Set Difference (`A - B`):**
   
   - This operation results in a set containing elements that are in A but not in B. In the Venn diagram, it's represented by the part of circle A that does not overlap with circle B.

4. **Symmetric Difference (`A Δ B`):**
   
   - The symmetric difference includes elements that are in either A or B but not in both. In Venn diagrams, this is depicted by shading the areas of circles A and B that do not overlap.
