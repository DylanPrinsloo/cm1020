set:                   S = {1, 2, 3}
cardinality:          |S| = 3
power set:             P(S) = {∅, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1,2}, {2,3}, {1,2,3}}

cardinality of power set: |P(S)| = 8 = 2^3 = 2^|S|


universal set  = `U`

Union = `A ∪ B`

intersection = `A ∩ B`

set difference = `A - B`

symmetric difference = `A Δ B`or `A + B`



de morgans law 
first law = (A ∪ B)′ = A′ ∩ B′

second law = (A ∩ B)′ = A′ ∪ B′


Commutativity (order does not matter) (subtraction/set difference DOES not work)

Associativity (grouping of elements in an operation) (addition) (set difference is NOT associative)

Distributivity (multiplication or division) 

Absorption Law added on the other laws with de morgans
