# Overview of a partition in a set

### 1. Key Definitions

- **Partition of a Set:** 
   
  A partition of an object (or set) is a way of breaking it into smaller parts such that:

  - The parts do not overlap; that is, they are **disjoint**.
  
  - When combined (i.e., the union of all parts), they reconstruct the original object or set.
  
- **Disjoint Sets:**  

  Two sets are disjoint if their intersection is the empty set. This means they have no elements in common.


### 2. Explanation Using Examples

- **Disjointed Sets with Venn Diagrams:**  
  
  The lecture starts by explaining disjoint sets with a Venn diagram, showing that two sets, say \( A \) and \( B \), are disjoint if \( A \cap B = \emptyset \).

- **Illustration of a Partition:**  
  
  A partition is defined as a collection of subsets \( \{ A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n \} \) of a set \( A \) such that:

  1. **Disjointness:** Each subset \( A_i \) is disjoint from every other subset \( A_j \) (i.e., \( A_i \cap A_j = \emptyset \) for \( i \neq j \)).
   
  2. **Union Covers the Whole:** The union of all subsets equals the original set \( A \), meaning no element is left out.
  
  An example provided shows five subsets \( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, \) and \( A_5 \) that are mutually disjoint and together form the complete set \( A \). This confirms that the collection is a valid partition of \( A \).

- **Exercise Example:**  
  
  The lecture includes an interactive exercise involving a set \( S \) with five elements: \(\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}\).  

  - **Option 1:** A collection of subsets where the union equals \( S \) and every pair is disjoint is a valid partition.
    
  - **Option 2:** Although the union equals \( S \), if any two subsets are not disjoint (i.e., they have overlapping elements such as having \( 4 \) in both subsets), then it is not a partition.  

  - **Option 3:** Even if all subsets are disjoint, if the union does not cover \( S \) completely, it cannot be considered a partition.

### 3. Conclusion

In summary, the lecture teaches that:
- **Partitioning** involves splitting a set into mutually exclusive (disjoint) subsets.
- The **union** of these subsets must recreate the original set.
- Through concrete examples and exercises, the importance of checking both disjointedness and completeness (union equals the original set) is emphasized, as both are necessary for a valid partition.
