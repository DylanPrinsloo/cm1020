### Combinatorics: Basic Counting Rules

Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics concerned with the study of finite or countable discrete structures. It focuses on the study of collections or arrangements of objects, specifically involving counting objects and studying the mathematical properties of different arrangements. As an important part of discrete mathematics, combinatorics has extensive applications in computer programming, physics, economics, probability theory, and many other fields.
