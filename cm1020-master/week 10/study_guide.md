## 1. Set Theory

### Key Concepts:
- **Sets**: Collections of distinct objects (elements)
- **Universal Set**: Contains all objects/elements under consideration
- **Set Operations**: Intersection, union, difference
- **Venn Diagrams**: Visual representation of relationships between sets
- **Power Sets**: Collection of all possible subsets of a given set

### Required Skills:
- Identify and classify sets
- Manipulate sets using intersection, union, and difference
- Represent sets visually through Venn diagrams
- Form power sets
- Use set theory laws to prove relationships (subset proofs)

## 2. Functions

### Key Concepts:
- **Function Components**: Domain, co-domain, range
- **Function Types**:
  - Injections (one-to-one)
  - Surjections (onto)
  - Bijections (both injective and surjective)
- **Function Composition**: Applying one function to another's result
- **Inverse Functions**: Reversing a function's action

### Required Skills:
- Determine types of functions
- Prove if a function is injective, surjective, or bijective
- Perform composition of functions
- Compute inverse functions

## 3. Logarithms

### Key Concepts:
- **Definition**: Power to which a base must be raised to obtain a value
- **Applications**: Solving equations with logarithmic expressions

### Required Skills:
- Calculate and interpret logarithmic expressions
- Solve logarithmic equations
- Apply logarithmic properties

---

## 4. Propositional Logic

### Key Concepts:
- **Propositions**: Statements that are either true or false
- **Truth Tables**: Tabular displays of logical operations
- **Tautologies**: Statements always true regardless of components
- **Logical Statements**: Contrapositive, converse, inverse
- **Logical Operators**: AND, OR, NOT, implication, equivalence

### Required Skills:
- Construct and interpret truth tables
- Identify tautologies, contrapositives, inversions, and converses
- Apply laws of propositional logic to simplify expressions
- Prove equivalence between propositions

---

## 5. Logical Arguments

### Key Concepts:
- **Premises and Conclusions**: Building blocks of arguments
- **Validity**: Whether a conclusion logically follows from premises
- **Reasoning Methods**: Deductive, inductive, etc.

### Required Skills:
- Assess argument validity
- Construct logical arguments
- Apply rules of inference
- Make correct conclusions based on given premises

---

## 6. Predicates

### Key Concepts:
- **Predicates**: Expressions that contain variables and become propositions when values are assigned
- **Quantifiers**: Universal (âˆ€) and existential (âˆƒ)
- **Negating Quantified Statements**: Applying De Morgan's laws

### Required Skills:
- Understand predicates and quantifiers
- Negate statements with quantifiers and implications
- Translate between formal logic and natural language
- Construct logical expressions using quantifiers

---

## 7. Boolean Algebra

### Key Concepts:
- **Binary Values**: Variables with only two possible values
- **Operations**: AND, OR, NOT
- **De Morgan's Laws**: Rules for negating compound expressions
- **Karnaugh Maps**: Visual method for simplifying Boolean expressions
- **Logic Circuits**: Implementation of Boolean functions

### Required Skills:
- Apply Boolean algebra operations
- Analyze and design logic circuits
- Apply De Morgan's laws
- Construct and interpret Karnaugh maps
- Simplify expressions to minimal sum of products
