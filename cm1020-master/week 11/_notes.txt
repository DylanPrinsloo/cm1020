What Recursion Actually Does:

Recursion doesn't "transition to an infinity base case." Instead, it works in the opposite 
direction - it breaks problems down from complex cases toward finite, well-defined base cases.

Recurrence Relations and Infinity:

Recurrence relations actually do have a relationship with infinity, but not in the way your original statement described. 
Here's the key distinction:


- What Recurrence Relations Actually Do
Recurrence relations define infinite sequences - they give us a rule that can generate infinitely many terms, but they don't 
"transition to an infinity base case." 

Instead:

    - They start with finite initial conditions (base cases)
    - They provide a rule for generating the next term from previous terms
    - This process can continue indefinitely, creating an infinite sequence
