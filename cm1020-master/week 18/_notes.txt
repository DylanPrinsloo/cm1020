Warshall's algorithm helps you figure out if there's a path — direct or indirect — between every pair of cities. 


What’s an Equivalence Class:

Key Properties:

1. Each item belongs to exactly one class
   (You can't be both "odd" and "even"!)

2. If two items are equivalent, they have the same class
   (If 1 ≡ 3, then \[1] = \[3])

3. The classes split the set into non-overlapping groups
   (No overlap, nothing left out)

Example with numbers:

Set: S = {1, 2, 3, 4}
Rule: "a ≡ b (mod 2)" → same odd/even

Then:

* \[1] = {1, 3} ← both odd
* \[2] = {2, 4} ← both even

That’s your set broken into equivalence classes!
