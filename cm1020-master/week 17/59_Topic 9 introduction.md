# Topic 9 Introduction: Relations

A **relation** typically refers to some connection or association between two entities, which may be living or nonliving. Examples from everyday life include:
- The relationship between a person and a relative (e.g., mother-daughter, brother-sister)
- The relationship between an employee and their salary
- The relationship between a business and its telephone number
- The relationship between a computer language and a valid statement in that language

Such relationships are foundational in various fields, including computer science.

## Mathematical Perspective

In mathematics, the concept of a relation is formalized to describe associations between elements of sets. Examples include:
- The relationship between a positive integer and another integer it divides
- The relationship between two real numbers
- The relationship between a real number \( x \) and the value \( f(x) \) for some function \( f \)

Mathematically, we can define:
- Relations between elements of **two different sets**
- Relations between elements **within the same set**
