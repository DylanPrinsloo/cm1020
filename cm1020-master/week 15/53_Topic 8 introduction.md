# Mathematical Trees - Lecture Notes

## Core Concept
Trees in computer science are data structures that mirror natural trees but are typically represented **upside down**. Like natural trees with roots, trunk, branches, and leaves, mathematical trees have hierarchical relationships between elements.

## Key Applications

### Organizational Systems
- **Organization charts**: Model hierarchical structures and reporting relationships
- **File systems**: Represent directory structures for efficient storage and retrieval
- **Version control**: Map relationships between central repositories and local working copies

### Algorithmic Applications
- **Pathfinding**: Find shortest paths in graphs
- **Search algorithms**: Efficiently locate items in datasets
- **Game theory**: Model decision trees for strategic games (chess, checkers)
- **Decision modeling**: Represent sequential decision-making processes

## Binary Trees
A **binary tree** is a fundamental data structure in high-level programming languages, forming the foundation for many tree-based algorithms.

## Summary
Trees provide a powerful mathematical framework for representing hierarchical relationships and solving complex computational problems. Their versatility spans from organizational modeling to advanced algorithmic applications.
